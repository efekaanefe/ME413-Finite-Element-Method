# ME413-Finite-Element-Method
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of various Finite Element Method (FEM) problems in structural analysis and heat diffusion. All computations are carried out from scratch using Python and the fundamental library numpy.

## Project Showcase

### 3D Frame Element Analysis  
Simulates the behavior of 3D frame structures under various loading conditions.
