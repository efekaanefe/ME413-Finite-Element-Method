# ME413-Finite-Element-Method
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of various Finite Element Method (FEM) problems in structural analysis and heat diffusion. All computations are carried out from scratch using Python and the fundamental library numpy.


## TODOs
- [x] Truss 1D
- [x] Truss 2D
- [x] Beam 2D
- [x] Frame 2D
- [x] Linear Elasticity 2D
- [x] Heat Diffusion 2D (steady)
- [x] Heat Diffusion 2D (transient)

- [ ] Frame 3D
- [ ] Modular package for all the different problems??

- [ ] Create showcase images for the repo
